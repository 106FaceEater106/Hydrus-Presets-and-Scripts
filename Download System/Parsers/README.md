# Parses
This is the good stuff, these parse HTML and JSON pages and URL given to them from the URL Class Linking.
These actually download the files or tells the client to download the files.
They also download all Metadata and tags on the posts if setup to do so. (most are)

These needs to be linked to an URL class to work, examples in parsers will let the client link these semi-automatically.

## .txt install
Copy the text of the text file into your clipboard (just Ctrl+C the whole text).
The open the Manage Parsers window under `Network>Downloader Definitions>Manage Parsers`
Press Import from clipboard.

These should work out of the box if URL Class links is up.
Without GUG's they will work in the URL Download tab.
They will require GUG's to work with the gallery download tab and subscriptions.
