# Download Sites
These grab images and LINKS that isn't really made to be handled with Hydrus.
These can be thumbnails for a post that has DDL links (download links like Google, Mega, Mediafire...)
They Should in theory grab the image of the post and tie all URLs to the one post image.
This will make it easy to export to other programs like [JDownloader2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2)
Hydrus can export these saved URLs in bulk to the clipboard of your OS either per URL Class or all in one.
