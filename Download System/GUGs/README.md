# GUG's (Gallery URL Generator's)
GUG's. GUG's! GUG's!!! Fun to say eh?

Well these do just whats described, they Generate Gallery URL's.
They automatically match with an URL Class.
They practically swap out a keyword (like %tags%) with the user query and inserts it into an URL which is matched with an URL class.

These will show up in your Gallery Download Tab and Subscriptions as choices for queries.


## .txt install
Copy the text of the text file into your clipboard (just Ctrl+C the whole text).
Then open `Network>Downloader Definition>Manage Gallery URL Generators` and press import from clipboard.

If you have an URL class matching the GUG it will automatically be matched with it.
Thats all there is too GUG to start using it.

## .png install
This will be expanded on when the dev adds easy import/exports and we actually exports all our stuff.
