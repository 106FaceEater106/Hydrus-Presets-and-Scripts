# nGUG's (Nested Gallery URL Generator's)
Nested GUG's tie together normal GUG's so the user can do one query (search) across many sites at one time.

These will show up in your Gallery Download Tab and Subscriptions as choices for queries.
It will also inform if the GUG its setup to support is available to use or not.


## .txt install
Copy the text of the text file into your clipboard (just Ctrl+C the whole text).
Then open `Network>Downloader Definition>Manage Gallery URL Generators>Nested Gallery URL Generators>` and press import from clipboard.

If you have an GUG matching the nGUG it will automatically be matched with it.
Thats all there is too nGUG to start using it.

## .png install
This will be expanded on when the dev adds easy import/exports and we actually exports all our stuff.
